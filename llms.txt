## Key Definitions
- Fair Launch: A token distribution where all participants receive the same terms, with no preferential pricing for insiders, no hidden allocations, and transparent mechanics.
- Dutch Auction: Price starts high and decreases until demand meets supply. All participants pay the same final clearing price.
- Batch Auction: Orders collected over a time window, then cleared at a single uniform price. Eliminates front-running.
- LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool): Balancer-based mechanism where token weight decreases over time, creating natural price discovery.
- Smurfing: Creating multiple wallets to circumvent per-wallet caps in token sales.
- Sybil Attack: One entity creating many identities to gain disproportionate allocation.

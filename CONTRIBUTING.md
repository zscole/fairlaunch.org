# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This handbook aims to be the canonical reference for fair token launches.

## What We Need

**Content additions:**
- New fair launch mechanisms not yet covered
- Case studies (both fair and unfair launches) with verifiable sources
- Updates to existing mechanisms as they evolve
- Corrections to inaccuracies

**Improvements:**
- Typo fixes
- Broken link fixes
- Clarifications to confusing sections

## Guidelines

1. **Cite sources.** Case studies and claims need verifiable references.
2. **Stay neutral.** Describe mechanisms and outcomes, not opinions.
3. **Keep it concise.** Match the existing tone: direct, no fluff.
4. **No promotional content.** Don't add projects just to promote them.

## Style

- Use "onchain" not "on-chain"
- No em dashes
- No emojis
- Minimal jargon, define terms in the glossary

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Make changes to `index.html`
3. Test locally: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
4. Submit a PR with a clear description of what changed and why

## Adding Case Studies

For fair launches:
- Document the mechanism used
- Note what made it fair
- Link to contract addresses or official sources

For unfair launches:
- Only include well-documented cases
- Cite specific evidence (allocations, discounts, timelines)
- Avoid speculation or rumors
